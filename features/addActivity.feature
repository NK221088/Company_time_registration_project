Feature: Add activity
  Description: A registered user registers an activity
  Actors: User

Scenario: Successful addition of activity to project
  Given a user is logged in
  And a project with project ID "24000" exists in the system
  When the user views the project with project ID "24000"
  And adds an activity named "Activity 1" to the project named "Project 1"
  Then the activity named "Activity 1" should be added to the project named "Project 1"
  And the activity named "Activity 1" should be shown when the project named "Project 1" is viewed

#I have added the the viewproject and half of the add activity feature. I had to make the function for creating the report, but have not really implemented it. We probably need to look at some of our variables at some point, as I feel some of them overlap. The person implementing the rest of the add activity should look at the new feature description for the first scenario and adapt the second scenario.
