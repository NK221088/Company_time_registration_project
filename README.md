# Misc
- Be sure to remove unnecessary tests, packages, classes, etc. from the example project in your final project. 
- Remember to create a `README.txt` (plain text) or a `README.md` (using Markdown) file that explains how to build and run the tests and the application and any necessary information to use the information, e.g., a short user manual and a description of any preset logins with password, if required.
